## Use Case

I was working on a algorithmic trading backtester in Python and wanted to create a user friendly way to edit backtesting settings — which I was keeping in a json file. At the time, I didn't know Javascript and the barrier of learning the language seemed too high for this one use. So

## Implementation

There is a javascript package called formio which is excellent for this very purpose. The idea is to yield one html file


this is an [Example Form](https://rawcdn.githack.com/dcorso21/PythonFormsFromJSON/b28b802a4fa35e71d7dea34ed22b2738114a512f/config_form.html)


```python
def function():
  this = lambda x: x**2
  return this
```
